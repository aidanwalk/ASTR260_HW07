Problem 1: Ensure AidanWalk_HW07_1.py and AidanWalk_partB_plot.py are in the same directory. Run AidanWalk_HW07_1.py by executing python AidanWalk_HW07_1.py. This will print the answer to A in the terminal and save a .png to the local directory for part B.

Problem 2: run AidanWalk_HW07_2.py by executing python AidanWalk_HW07_2.py. This will calculate and print the values for L1 and L2 via Newtons and Secant method. A negative value is indicative of the point being located between Earth and Sun, measured as a distance from Earth. A positive value means that the point is located beyond the orbit of Earth, directly away from the sun, measured as a distance from Earth. All units are in meters.
