# ASTR260_HW07
Problem 1: Ensure AidanWalk_HW07_1.py and AidanWalk_partB_plot.py are in the same directory. Run AidanWalk_HW07_1.py by executing python AidanWalk_HW07_1.py. This will print the answer to A in the terminal and save a .png to the local directory for part B. The .png is plotted from data in the file 'problem6_1_data.txt'. This file is generated and saved in the local directory when AidanWalk_HW07_1.py is ran.

Problem 2: run AidanWalk_HW07_2.py by executing python AidanWalk_HW07_2.py. This will calculate and print the values for L1 and L2 via Newtons and Secant method. A negative value is indicative of the point being located between Earth and Sun, measured as a distance from Earth. A positive value means that the point is located beyond the orbit of Earth, directly away from the sun, measured as a distance from Earth. All units are in meters as indicated.

BEWARE: For Newtons Method, if my max iterations is anything less than 1e6, I do not get good values for L1 and L2. It takes a few seconds to calculate each L1 and L2 during run time. I have varied my initial 'guess' by several magnitudes, no matter the guess I still need 1 million iterations to converge on an answer. How can I fix this?
